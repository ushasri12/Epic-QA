Furthermore, expedient treatment of patients with high dose MDI therapy augmented with more rapid initiation of systemic therapy may help ensure patients are less likely to deteriorate to the stage where nebulisers are required.  The utilization of nebulised therapy potentially increases the risk of aerosolization of the coronavirus.  Protocols that include strategies to allow flexibility in using MDIs rather than nebulisers in all but the most severe patients should help mitigate this risk of aerosolised infection transmission to patients and health care providers.

Encoded by nsp3, PLpro is one of two known CoV proteases and is required for the efficient cleavage of nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 from the viral polyprotein, a process essential for viral genome transcription and replication.  Overall, this study sheds light on SARS-CoV2 PLpro and its role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 by characterizing its deISGylation activity.

However, given the increasing possible influence of preexisting cross-reactive antibodies on potential protection or disease enhancement (8), here we aimed to deeply profile and determine whether previous common CoV immunity shapes the evolution of the response to SARS-CoV-2.  However, despite the lack of seasonal protection against common CoVs, speculations have arisen related to the potential role of cross-CoV immunity in shaping the response to SARS-CoV-2.

Our data indicated that SAP is a key negative regulator for innate immune responses to DNA and may be partly responsible for the insufficient immune responses after DNA vaccinations in humans.  We hypothesize that serum amyloid P component (SAP), which has a species-specific, DNA-binding ability, contributes to the differences between human and mice and then limits DNA vaccine's efficacy in vivo.

What specific roles do different TLRs or PRRs of innate immune receptors play in inducing the differentiation of long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells? What roles do B cell intrinsic TLRs play in generating long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells? In addition, the roles played by the non-TLR viral sensors (RIG-I, Mda-5, MAVS, protein kinase R) in mediating effective adaptive immunity remain to be further defined.  Recent studies to understand host responses upon pathogen exposure provide evidence that molecular recognition of pathogens by cells of the innate immune system plays a significant role in determining the nature of the adaptive T and B cell immune responses.  To develop more effective measures against highly variable pathogens, we need a better understanding of the molecular and cellular interactions between host and pathogen, and determine how mucosal and T-cell-mediated immunities contribute to protection.

Given the accumulating evidence for coagulopathy associated with COVID-19, patients with psychosis who acquire COVID-19 may be at enhanced risk for thromboembolic complications While this potential link is informed by the risk factors and evidence for hypercoagulation associated with both conditions, in the absence of sufficient data it remains speculative. It has been recently shown that COVID-19 is associated with a clinically significant coagulopathy.  Patients with COVID-19 are likely to be less mobile in the context of their infection, especially in severe cases, increasing the risk of stasis.  There is an urgent need for research to formally evaluate the risk of thromboembolic complications in patients with psychosis who develop infection with COVID-19 to guide clinical management decisions in this population\n",

In that regard, previous traumatic exposures may serve as a buffer against the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Haitians.

Therefore, cross-immunity of this sort is not immunity to infection and is not expected to 'supplement' herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.  For example, for vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, in the absence of sterilizing immunity, several of the proposed models of how cross-reactive T cell memory could provide partial protective immunity may exist in parallel with the immunity induced by a vaccine.

Notably, our modeling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly defined forces.  Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: 1) \"mitigation,\" which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and 2) \"suppression,\" aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population.  Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterized to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United Kingdom, we assessed the long-term prospects of success using both of these approaches.  Specifically, we found that 1) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, 2) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be adaptive over time in a precise yet unfeasible way, and 3) social distancing must be maintained for an extended period to ensure the healthcare system is not overwhelmed\n",

For a first-in-human study (and subsequent clinical studies), such signals trigger the implementation of relevant clinical safety endpoints to detect potential clinical manifestations of such bindings or confirm that it does not occur in patients\n",

            " This is among the first studies, to the best of our knowledge, that measures real life compliance with face masks during this COVID-19 pandemic  The remainder used masks incorrectly, which is evidence of the worst scenario of people believing that they are protected when they are not  To evaluate if, how often, and in what way people wear their face masks, we conducted an observational study in five major cities in the Baixada Santista metropolitan area with a sample of over 12,000 observations  In this study, over three consecutive days, we observed 12,588 people in the streets wearing, or not, masks in their routine lives  Nonetheless, with every new day, COVID-19 becomes an easier and less frightening subject for the less informed 1% of people wore face masks properly and safely in a research sample observed in a region with significant prevalence of COVID-19, among people at high risk of infection (because of poverty and high prevalence) and complications (due to age and pre-existing health conditions)  Many people complain of a lack of oxygen while wearing masks  For a proper risk assessment, it is critical to understand the degree of public compliance with protective measures  Face masks have grown in relevance during this pandemic, particularly going from health care facilities to the average people daily activities  This suggests that many mask-wearing people were feeling safe, but in reality, were not, and therefore risking presence in the streets in an inadvisable fashion\n",

            " An in-depth understanding of trends in the health and functioning of care home residents is needed as care providers and policy makers strive to meet the needs of this complex population  Full details of the CFAS I [9] and CFAS II study design and methods have been described in detail elsewhere [7]   Baseline (cross sectional) weights were released into both studies  Participants are interviewed approximately every 2 years [5]   In the absence of a minimum dataset on UK care home residents, this study set out to synthesise data from existing cohort studies of ageing in England in Wales  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted August 6, 2020  The aim is to investigate how the health and functioning of care home residents in epidemiological studies in England and Wales has changed over time  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted August 6, 2020  Conclusion Over two decades, there has been an increase in disability and the complexity of health problems amongst care home residents in England and Wales  The prevalence of complex multimorbidity (problems in at least three out of six body systems) increased within studies over time, from 33% to 54% in CFAS I/II between 1992 and 2012, and 26% to 54% in ELSA between 2006 and 2016\n",

            " Disturbingly, statins might also promote the activation of the inflammasome pathway in ARDS resulting in increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-18 (IL-18), 5 and, as a result, more severe disease due to an IL-18 induction of an interferon c-biased cytokine storm  Investigators reporting on COVID-19 clinical trials or retrospective studies should also include what drugs the subjects are taking at baseline and throughout the illness so the medical community can determine if indeed ARB or statin treatments portend a worse outcome with COVID-19  5 Baseline IL-18 levels were positively associated with subsequent morbidity and mortality  Moreover, subjects randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg daily for the 28-day trial were more likely to exhibit a rise in IL-18 levels and that rise was significantly associated with increased mortality  This is vitally important in a spreading pandemic, potentially victimizing an older population  Conflict of interest: None declared  Notably, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for cell entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is abundantly expressed by alveolar type II epithelial cells  Attention to this might save countless lives  In the meantime, clinicians need to decide on an individual basis if an ACE-inhibitor should be substituted for an ARB for blood pressure control and if statin treatment should be halted during the pandemic, particularly if statins are being used for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease  1, 2 We posit that drugs commonly used in the treatment of those comorbidities may actually increase the risk of severe pneumonia, ARDS, and mortality in the setting of COVID-19; the drugs of primary concern include angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) used for blood pressure lowering and statins used for cholesterol lowering\n",

            " However, the psychological effects of lockdown measures have been neglected, and the related theoretical research lags behind the practice  In conclusion, under the SOR framework, the lockdown measures had a buffer effect on social anxiety in pandemic regions, with the mediating role of psychological distancing  For that, this research investigated how lockdown measures and psychological distance influenced social anxiety in the pandemic region  The Chinese national data was analyzed for the outcome Lockdown measures have been widely used to control and prevent virus transmission in pandemic regions  The present study aimed to better understand the mechanism of social anxiety in pandemic regions where the lockdown measures were imposed, based on the conceptual framework of the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR)  The results showed that (1) psychological distance mediated the relationship between pandemic COVID-19 severity and social anxiety, (2) lockdown measures buffered the detrimental effect of the COVID-19 pandemic severity on social anxiety, (3) lockdown measures moderated the mediation effect of psychological distancing on social anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic \n",

            " Second, we analyzed only COVID-19 patients with a positive rRT-PCR result from a nasopharyngeal swab  The study suggested that most transmission of COVID-19 occurred at the very early stage of the disease or even before the onset of symptoms, and the secondary clinical attack rate among contacts J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f decreased over time as symptoms developed and progressed [9]   Thus, we do not think that asymptomatic patients need to stay hospitalized after their symptoms improved even when the result of rRT-PCR remains to be positive  Third, we did not analyze correlation between Ct-value and the infectiousness of COVID-19 in this study  To prevent medical collapse, the discharge criteria for COVID-19 patients by negative result of SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR should be reconsidered  This pandemic caused health problems of human beings and an economic decline worldwide  The median age of the patients was 48 years (range 16-92 years)  The discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients using a negative result of rRT-PCR should be reconsidered  This is the first report documenting J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f that Ct-value of rRT-PCR could not reflect the disease severity and activity of COVID-19  Results of rRT-PCR assay could remain positive among asymptomatic patients for longer than 2 weeks\n",

            " To date, only two studies have analyzed the outcomes of severity and mortality in patients with diabetes with COVID-19, based on the level of glycemic control 4% vs  Although various studies and their meta-analysis have recently shown that the patients with diabetes have a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 and increased mortality, no studies were available until recently, that analyzed the relation of glycemic control to severity and mortality in COVID-19  Interestingly, this study by Zhu et al [4] also sub-analyzed the data of 500 patients of diabetes with COVID-19, after conducting a 1:1 propensity score-matching (matched for other comorbidities that include hypertension, cardio-and cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease) and compared the outcomes of 250 patients with diabetes in each group  Interestingly, in a retrospective study of 52 COVID-19 patient, Wang et al [11] found an evidence of acute pancreatic injury (diagnosed by raised amylase and lipase) in 17% of the patients, in the absence of any known risk factor that may cause acute pancreatitis BACKGROUND AND AIM: Diabetes in often associated with an increased severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19  Figure 1 depicts the diagrammatic representation of findings from the propensity-matched arms 5% vs  More studies will further strengthen our knowledge with regards to the relationship of glycemic control to the severity and mortality in patients with diabetes and COVID-19  Thus, we sought to find the relation of glycemic control to the severity and mortality with COVID-19 in patients with diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia\n",

            " CONCLUSION \"You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency  Climate action can save the world, but it can also seriously perturb the lifestyle we are so attached to  Examples include buying goods locally, decreasing the use of high-carbon emission transport means, investing in a green economy, or eating less meat  On the one hand, these attitudes can reflect specific reactions to eating disorder symptoms, especially when what is at stake is the well-being of a loved one  MI was initially prescribed for patients with problematic alcohol use [21] , yet has also been tested and validated in an increasing number of studies for a range of target problems [22]   Disinvestment should not be confused with more forceful, and presumably less effective, confronting strategies  Because greenhouse gas emissions will invariably continue to rise unless drastic political measures are in place, it is our social and political, rather than individual position that matters the most in understanding and facing the situation  Disinvestment from public affairs can be interpreted in a very wide sense  Decreasing greenhouse gas emissions would significantly compromise our way of life  Unfortunately, and despite a wide range of options for accelerating energy transition [6] , politicians are still very timid when implementing climate action [7] \n",
